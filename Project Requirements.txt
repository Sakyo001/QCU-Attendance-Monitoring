Web-Based Facial Recognition Attendance System (Offline-First PWA)
1. Project Overview

The Web-Based Facial Recognition Attendance System is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to automate student attendance through facial recognition technology. The system operates in both online and offline environments and implements role-based access control, ensuring that users can only access features relevant to their role.

All professor accounts are created and managed by the administrator, and each professor is automatically linked to their assigned subjects, sections, schedules, and rooms, which are displayed upon login.

2. System Objectives (Updated)

In addition to previously defined objectives, the system specifically aims to:

Centralize control of professor accounts under the administrator

Automatically bind professors to their designated sections, subjects, and rooms

Eliminate manual setup by professors, ensuring consistent schedule enforcement

Improve attendance accuracy through strict section–room–schedule validation

3. User Roles and Functional Responsibilities (Revised)
3.1 Administrator (Registrar / Admin Portal)

Primary Role: System control, academic structure management, and analytics.

Functions:

Create, update, activate, and deactivate professor accounts

Create and manage:

Sections

Subjects

Classrooms / Rooms

Academic schedules (day, time, shift)

Assign:

Professors to specific subjects

Subjects to sections

Sections to rooms and schedules

Automatically link assigned data to professor accounts

Manage student records and section enrollment

View system-wide analytics:

Attendance per professor

Attendance per section and room

Student count per section

Generate and export attendance reports

Manage system configuration, data synchronization, backup, and restore

Enforce data privacy, access control, and security policies

3.2 Professor / Adviser Portal (Auto-Provisioned)

Primary Role: Attendance session execution and monitoring.

Login Behavior:

Professor accounts are created by the administrator

Upon login, the system automatically displays:

Assigned subjects

Assigned sections

Assigned rooms

Assigned schedules / shifts

Functions:

Select an assigned:

Subject

Section

Room

Schedule / Shift

Open an attendance session (required before scanning)

Activate facial recognition attendance capture

View real-time attendance during sessions

View attendance analytics for assigned sections:

Present and absent students

Attendance trends (daily, weekly, monthly)

Individual student attendance records

Generate and download attendance reports

No permission to modify sections, schedules, or assignments

3.3 Student Portal (View-Only Attendance)

Primary Role: Attendance transparency.

Functions:

Register facial data for recognition

Mark attendance using facial recognition during an active session

View:

Daily attendance status

Attendance history per subject and section

Track personal attendance performance

No editing or administrative access

4. Functional Flow (Professor Login Scenario)

Administrator creates a professor account

Administrator assigns:

Subject(s)

Section(s)

Room(s)

Schedule(s)

Professor logs in

System automatically loads assigned:

Sections

Rooms

Subjects

Schedules

Professor selects a valid combination

Professor opens an attendance session

Students scan faces to record attendance

5. Key System Features (Reinforced)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Admin-controlled account provisioning

Automatic schedule and room validation

Duplicate attendance prevention per session

Offline-first attendance storage with IndexedDB

Secure facial embedding storage

Encrypted data transmission and authentication

Attendance analytics per professor, section, and room

6. Technical Architecture (Unchanged)

PWA: React.js + TypeScript

Facial Recognition: FaceNet (face-api.js / TensorFlow.js)

Offline Storage: IndexedDB

Backend: FastAPI or Node.js

Database: PostgreSQL

Authentication: JWT + Role-based access

7. Success Indicators (Updated)

Professors see assigned sections and rooms immediately upon login

Attendance cannot be recorded outside assigned schedules

Accurate attendance data linked to correct professor, section, and room

Reduced configuration errors and administrative overhead

High user acceptance and system reliability
